## Abstract
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of customer segmentation in e-commerce using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and advanced clustering techniques. Using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we implemented K-means clustering to identify distinct customer segments and developed a systematic approach for customer behavior analysis. Our findings reveal four primary customer clusters with distinct characteristics, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies and customer relationship management.

## I. Introduction
In today's competitive e-commerce landscape, understanding customer behavior and effectively segmenting customers has become crucial for business success. Customer segmentation in e-commerce involves dividing the customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics such as purchasing behavior, demographics, browsing patterns, and lifetime value. This segmentation enables businesses to:
- Tailor marketing strategies to specific customer groups
- Optimize product recommendations
- Customize user experiences based on segment characteristics
- Improve conversion rates and customer retention
- Enhance average order value through personalized approaches

The importance of data-driven decision-making in this context cannot be overstated, as it allows businesses to move beyond intuition-based strategies to measurable, empirical approaches.

## II. Methodology

### A. Data Preparation
The study utilized the online retail dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data preparation process involved several key steps:

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Removal of missing values
   - Elimination of negative quantities and prices
   - Conversion of invoice dates to proper datetime format
   - Filtering of invalid customer IDs

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Implementation of RFM metrics:
     - Recency: Days since last purchase
     - Frequency: Number of distinct purchases
     - Monetary: Total amount spent
   - Scaling of RFM values for clustering accuracy

The RFM features are calculated using the following approach:
```R
rfm_data <- clean_retail_data %>%
  group_by(CustomerID) %>%
  summarise(
    # Recency: days since last purchase
    Recency = as.numeric(difftime(max_date, max(InvoiceDate), units = "days")),
    # Frequency: number of purchases
    Frequency = n_distinct(InvoiceNo),
    # Monetary: total money spent
    Monetary = sum(Quantity * UnitPrice)
  ) %>%
  # Remove any rows where CustomerID is NA
  filter(!is.na(CustomerID))
```

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$R_i = max(Date) - max(Date_i)$$
$$F_i = |distinct(InvoiceNo_i)|$$
$$M_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (Quantity_{ij} \cdot UnitPrice_{ij})$$

Where:
- \(R_i\) is the recency for customer \(i\)
- \(F_i\) is the frequency for customer \(i\)
- \(M_i\) is the monetary value for customer \(i\)
- \(n_i\) is the number of transactions for customer \(i\)

### B. Clustering Algorithms and Initial Analysis

![RFM Distributions](media/plots/rfm_distributions.png)

The initial analysis of RFM metrics revealed distinct patterns in customer behavior:

1. Frequency Distribution:
   - Highly left-skewed distribution
   - Majority of customers with low purchase frequency (<50 purchases)
   - Small subset of highly frequent purchasers

2. Monetary Distribution:
   - Extreme left-skew with long tail
   - Most customers in lower spending brackets
   - Few high-value outliers representing major revenue contributors

3. Recency Distribution:
   - More uniform distribution compared to other metrics
   - Gradual decline in customer counts with increasing recency
   - Notable long tail indicating potential churn risks

The k-means clustering algorithm minimizes the following objective function:

$$J = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{k} w_{ij} ||x_i - \mu_j||^2$$

Where:
- \(J\) is the objective function to minimize
- \(n\) is the number of data points
- \(k\) is the number of clusters
- \(w_{ij}\) is 1 if point \(i\) belongs to cluster \(j\), 0 otherwise
- \(x_i\) is the feature vector for point \(i\)
- \(µ_j\) is the centroid of cluster \(j\)

```R
# k-means clustering with optimal k
optimal_k <- 4
final_clusters <- kmeans(rfm_scaled, centers = optimal_k, nstart = 25)

rfm_clustered <- rfm_data %>%
  mutate(Cluster = factor(final_clusters$cluster))
```

The optimal number of clusters was determined through two complementary methods:

![Silhouette Plot](media/plots/silhouette_plot.png)

1. Silhouette Analysis:
   - Highest score at k=2 (0.89)
   - Notable drop after k=4 (0.62)
   - Diminishing returns beyond k=4
   - Supports selection of 4 clusters for balance between granularity and cohesion

![Elbow Plot](media/plots/elbow_plot.png)

2. Elbow Method:
   - Sharp decline in within-cluster sum of squares until k=4
   - Flattening of curve after k=4
   - Confirms optimal cluster count of 4
   - Additional clusters provide minimal reduction in variance

## III. Results Analysis

### A. Segment Profiling

![Cluster Summary](media/plots/cluster_summary.png)

The analysis revealed four distinct clusters with unique characteristics:

1. Cluster 3 (Potential Loyalists):
   - Size: 3,060 customers (70.54%)
   - Average Recency: 43.43 days
   - Average Frequency: 3.68 purchases
   - Average Monetary Value: $1,358.17
   - Moderate RFM scores (R: 3.51, F: 3.22, M: 3.20)

2. Cluster 1 (Average Customers):
   - Size: 1,061 customers (24.46%)
   - Average Recency: 248.17 days
   - Average Frequency: 1.55 purchases
   - Average Monetary Value: $478.19
   - Lower RFM scores (R: 1.19, F: 1.98, M: 2.01)

3. Cluster 4 (Champions):
   - Size: 204 customers (4.70%)
   - Average Recency: 14.96 days
   - Average Frequency: 22.33 purchases
   - Average Monetary Value: $12,709.09
   - High RFM scores (R: 4.62, F: 4.96, M: 4.99)

4. Cluster 2 (VIP Customers):
   - Size: 13 customers (0.30%)
   - Average Recency: 6.62 days
   - Average Frequency: 82.54 purchases
   - Average Monetary Value: $127,338.31
   - Highest RFM scores (R: 4.77, F: 4.85, M: 5.00)

### B. Detailed Value Distribution Analysis

![Boxplot Monetary by Cluster](media/plots/boxplot_monetary_by_cluster.png)

The monetary value distribution across clusters reveals distinct spending patterns:

1. VIP Customers (Cluster 2):
   - Highest median monetary value (~85,000)
   - Substantial interquartile range (45,000-130,000)
   - Notable outliers exceeding 200,000
   - Clear separation from other clusters

2. Champions (Cluster 4):
   - Moderate monetary values (median ~15,000)
   - Compact distribution with some high-value outliers
   - Consistent spending patterns

3. Average & Potential Loyalists (Clusters 1 & 3):
   - Similar monetary distributions
   - Lower median values (<5,000)
   - Minimal variance in spending
   - Occasional outliers indicating growth potential

#### Recency Patterns

![Histogram Recency by Cluster](media/plots/histogram_recency_by_cluster.png)

The recency distribution highlights engagement patterns:

1. Recent Engagement:
   - Clusters 1 & 3 show high concentration in 0-50 day range
   - Clear peak in very recent activity (<30 days)
   - Strong active customer base

2. Temporal Distribution:
   - Cluster 3 shows even distribution across time periods
   - Cluster 1 concentrated in recent periods
   - Long tail extending to 350+ days
   - Natural segmentation points at 100 and 200 days

#### Value-Frequency Relationship

![Scatter Frequency vs Monetary](media/plots/scatter_frequency_vs_monetary.png)

The relationship between purchase frequency and monetary value reveals:

1. Cluster Characteristics:
   - Cluster 2: High frequency and high value, clear outliers
   - Cluster 4: Moderate frequency, consistent value
   - Cluster 3: Low to moderate frequency, variable value
   - Cluster 1: Low frequency, low value concentration

### C. Churn Risk Analysis

![Churn Heatmap](media/plots/churn_heatmap.png)

The study implemented a comprehensive churn risk assessment framework that revealed distinct patterns:

For the churn risk analysis, we calculate an engagement score:

```R
    Engagement_Score = (
      scale(Frequency) + 
      scale(Monetary) + 
      scale(-Recency)
    ) / 3
```

Mathematically represented as:

$$E_i = \frac{Z(F_i) + Z(M_i) - Z(R_i)}{3}$$

Where:
- \(E_i\) is the engagement score for customer \(i\)
- \(Z()\) is the standardization function
- \(F_i\), \(M_i\), and \(R_i\) are the frequency, monetary, and recency values respectively

1. Active Customers:
   - Maintain consistently low churn probability (<20%)
   - Show regular engagement patterns
   - Demonstrate stable purchasing behavior

2. High-Risk Segment:
   - Display nearly 100% churn probability
   - Typically inactive for >150 days and have low or no purchases
   - Sharp transition point around 150-day mark
   - Clear separation from active customer base

![Recency vs Churn](media/plots/recency_vs_churn.png)

Further analysis of transaction patterns reveals clear clustering of high-risk customers in the low-frequency zone, while active customers show varied transaction frequencies with clear stratification between risk levels.

### D. Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

![Sales Forecast Prophet](media/plots/sales_forecast_prophet.png)

The Prophet forecasting model revealed several key insights:

For the time series forecasting, we use Prophet's additive model:

$$y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \epsilon_t$$

Where:
- \(g(t)\) is the trend function
- \(s(t)\) is the seasonal component
- \(h(t)\) is the holiday component
- \(\epsilon_t\) is the error term

```R
prophet_model <- prophet(
  monthly_sales_clean,
  growth = 'linear',
  yearly.seasonality = FALSE,
  weekly.seasonality = FALSE,
  daily.seasonality = FALSE,
  seasonality.mode = 'additive',
  changepoint.prior.scale = 0.01,
  n.changepoints = 2
)
```

1. Historical Trend Analysis:
   - Significant volatility in actual sales from January 2011 to July 2011
   - Notable dip in sales during April 2011
   - Strong upward trajectory beginning in October 2011
   - Overall increasing trend despite monthly fluctuations

2. Forecast Trend:
   - Linear growth projection extending into early 2012
   - Baseline trend showing steady increase from approximately 400,000 to over 1,000,000 in sales
   - Conservative growth estimate compared to recent historical spikes
   - Reduced sensitivity to short-term fluctuations

## IV. Business Implications and Strategic Recommendations
